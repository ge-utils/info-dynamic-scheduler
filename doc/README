Sun Grid Engine Information Reporter 
Version 0.11 - April 2008
====================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1	ABOUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an information reporter implementation for Sun Grid Engine[1], 
designed to be used within the Generic Information Provider (GIP)[2] 
framework as used in LCG-2_6_0.  It was written for use at the London 
e-Science Centre[3] at Imperial College, London but is intended to be
sufficiently general purpose that it can be used at other sites.

This software is considered *beta* -- you use it at your own risk, and 
although many changes have been incorporated to increase the chances of
it working with a wide variety of SGE configurations,  there is no
guarantee that it is compatible with the way in which your site is 
configured.   See below for details of how to report feedback.

The maintainers are aware of areas in which the information reporter
needs further improvement,  and at least one further release is planned 
for the near future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2     PREREQUISITES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This software requires that you have:
	* Perl (tested with 5.8.1, earlier versions probably work.)
	* XML::Simple library for Perl.
	* Sun Grid Engine version 6.0 or later.  Versions prior to 6.0
	  will _not_ function.  (The current implementation depends
          on the '-xml' functionality added in the 6.0 release.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3	INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation of the information reporter is trivial:

a) copy the lcg-info-dynamic-sge file to your GIP dynamic plug-in
   directory  (at LeSC this is the directory /opt/lcg/libexec)

b) create a config file based on the included sample-info-reporter.conf
   file

   The default location for this file is: 

	/etc/sge-jobmanager/info-reporter.conf

   See the comments within the sample file for information about the
   supported configuration options.     Most of the configuration options
   can also be specified on the lcg-info-reporter-sge command line

c) Once done you will need to update your GIP configuration to use the new 
   plugin script; this is done by adding the following line:

	dynamic_script=/opt/lcg/libexec/lcg-info-dynamic-sge /opt/lcg/var/gip/lcg-info-generic.conf

   Note 1: the current maintainer has not double-checked that this step
           is still correct as his site was already running a previous
           version of the information reporter,  and therefore the
           new version could simply be dropped in place

   Note 2: Update the paths as appropriate for your system.  The above 
           represents the default locations on LCG-2_6_0 installations.

d) Ensure that the script is readable and executable by the user that will run
   it (ie 'edginfo' on LCG-2_6_0 installations) and that the SGE JobManager 
   configuration is readable by this user.   You should also check that this 
   user is permitted to query your local cluster's state with the `qstat`,
   `qconf` and `qselect` commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3	TESTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing is possible by either running the plugin directly on the command 
line or by querying the ldap server running on the CE using the `ldapsearch`
command.

The following incantation should return the current reported state of your
cluster:

ldapsearch -x -H ldap://name.of.ce.host:2135/ -b Mds-Vo-name=local,o=grid

If the script is successfully reporting information, you should be able to 
find a GlueCEInfoLRMSType field set to 'sge' (or similiar) and a 
GlueCEInfoLRMSVersion that matches your local installation.

A utility "compare-output" is included to assist in comparing the
output of different versions of the information reporter plugin and/or 
ldapsearch    (though comparing the direct output from the information 
plugin against the ldapsearch output is not currently very useful as the 
SGE info reporter is only responsible for generating a small subset of 
the information returned by ldapsearch)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4	FEEDBACK & PROBLEMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any problems/feedback relating to the information reporter should be
sent via email to the current maintainer as listed in the AUTHORS
file.

Version 0.6 of the information reporter introduced a new feature whereby
all of the information gathered from input files & SGE commands whilst
calculating an information report can be saved into a file.  This
file contains all of the information needed by the maintainers to replay
an info-reporter run to track down and (hopefully) fix any problems.
See the "capture_file" option in the sample-info-reporter.conf file.
