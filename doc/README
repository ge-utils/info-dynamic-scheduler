Sun Grid Engine - GIP LRMS and BLAHP-helper interfaces
======================================================

Version:  0.903
Date:     23rd December 2008

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ABOUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting from version 0.900,  this program currently has two primary
functions...

a) To provide support for the Sun Grid Engine (SGE)[1] batch system within
   the Generic Information Provider (GIP)[2] framework used by the LCG
   and glite software stacks

b) To act as a helper program for use by the SGE interface to BLAHP 
   that is used on Computing Elements (CEs) using glite and CREAM
   software    (as opposed to the older LCG CE which was based around
   globus)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PREREQUISITES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This software requires:

* Perl   

  Tested with 5.8 & 5.10

* XML::Twig perl module 

  Tested with 3.32,  but any version later than 3.0 should probably work

  NOTE:  Earlier versions of lcg-info-dynamic-sge used XML::Simple instead

* Time::Local perl module

* Sun Grid Engine version 6.0 or later

  Tested with 6.0u9, 6.1u3 and 6.1u5

  Versions of SGE prior to 6.0 lack the required XML support

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION for use as Information Plugin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

a) Install the script sge_helper in a location of your choice

   Create symlinks in the directory /opt/lcg/libexec to allow the
   program to be run using the following names:

   /opt/lcg/libexec/lcg-info-dynamic-sge
   /opt/lcg/libexec/lrmsinfo-sge
   /opt/lcg/libexec/vomaxjobs-sge


   IF you don't want to create these symlinks then you can also
   call the program using its original name and add the arguments
   "--info", "--lrmsinfo" or "--vomaxjobs" respectively to select
   the appropriate output.      All of the locations described
   below where the name of the program needs to be specified allow
   arguments to be given.

b) Modify the configuration file for lcg-info-dynamic-scheduler...
   (normally: /opt/glite/etc/lcg-info-dynamic-scheduler.conf)

   * Make sure the "[Main]" section includes sensible values for
     "static_ldif_file" and "vomap"

   * In the section "[LRMS]" set the value of "lrms_backend_cmd" to:

     lrms_backend_cmd : /opt/lcg/libexec/lrmsinfo-sge -c /opt/glite/etc/lcg-info-dynamic-scheduler.conf

   * Optionally:   

     IF SGE is setup with differing numbers of slots per queue 
     AND the different queues are setup for different VOs
     AND you want slightly better estimates to be calculated for
         the per vo freeslot values
	 
     THEN

     Add the following to the section "[Scheduler]"

     vo_max_jobs_cmd : /opt/lcg/libexec/vomaxjobs-sge -c /opt/glite/etc/lcg-info-dynamic-scheduler.conf


     NOTE:  Enabling this option currently doubles the length of time
     that lcg-info-dynamic-scheduler takes to run,  and probably won't
     have any effect on the results unless the conditions above are 
     satisfied.

     Use of this option is strongly discouraged,  and discussions
     are underway at removing this option in favour of trying to
     persuade the authors of lcg-info-dynamic-scheduler to 
     modify the batch system interface used by their code.

c) Optionally create the following configuration files:

   * /etc/sge-jobmanager/cluster.state

     Containing the current status of the cluster 
     (either: Production, Queueing, Draining or Closed)

     If the file is missing, then the cluster state defaults to
     "Production"

   * /etc/sge-jobmanager/info-reporter.conf

     Containing a configuration file similar to the one used by previous
     versions of lcg-info-dynamic-sge

     Note: Not all of the configuration options from earlier versions
           of lcg-info-dynamic-sge actually do anything in this
           version of the software
 	  
     A combination of command line arguments and the contents of this
     file can be used to override most of the defaults used by the
     program.

   * /etc/sge-jobmanager/vqueues.conf

     Note: This file isn't needed if there is a one-to-one mapping
           between the queue names used by SGE and the queues that
           appear in your static ldif file

	   It should only be needed if you wish to use virtual queues
           as supported by one of the job managers developed at 
           Imperial College London.

	   If you are using the job manager developed by CESGA then
	   you are better off NOT creating this file

	   Starting from version 0.902,  this file will only be read
           from its default location if the use of LeSC's job manager
           is detected (from the presense of "sge" rather than "lcgsge"
           in the static ldif file)

d) Ensure that the sge commands "qstat" and "qconf" work when run
   by the login account used by the information reporter 
   (typically: edginfo)

e) Ensure that the "gip" plugin directory contains scripts that will run
   the following two commands:

   /opt/lcg/libexec/lcg-info-dynamic-scheduler -c /opt/glite/etc/lcg-info-dynamic-scheduler.conf
   /opt/lcg/libexec/lcg-info-dynamic-sge -c /opt/glite/etc/lcg-info-dynamic-scheduler.conf

   The gip plugin directory is normally located:

        /opt/lcg/var/gip/plugin        (glite 3.0)
   or   /opt/glite/etc/gip/plugin      (glite 3.1)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. TESTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing is possible by either running the programs directly on the command 
line or by querying the ldap server running on the CE using the `ldapsearch`
command.      

Note: Starting from version 1.000 both "lcg-info-dynamic-sge" and
"lcg-info-dynamic-scheduler" need to be run instead of just 
"lcg-info-dynamic-sge"


The following incantation should return the current reported state of your
cluster:

glite 3.0:

ldapsearch -x -H ldap://name.of.ce.host:2135/ -b Mds-Vo-name=local,o=grid

glite 3.1:

ldapsearch -x -H ldap://name.of.ce.host:2170/ -b Mds-Vo-name=resource,o=grid

A utility "compare-output" is included to assist in comparing the
output of different versions of the information reporter plugin and/or 
ldapsearch    (though comparing the direct output from the information 
plugin against the ldapsearch output is not currently very useful as the 
SGE info reporter is only responsible for generating a small subset of 
the information returned by ldapsearch)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Some versions of SGE 6.1 prior to 6.1u5 have a bug in their XML output 
  that can cause "slot" counts for queues to be wrong.   

  A workaround has been implemented that is applied if a version of SGE is 
  detected that is known to exhibit this bug  (currently 6.1u3 and 6.1u4),
  however it hasn't been confirmed that the workaround is correct in all
  circumstances,   and there may well be other versions of SGE that suffer
  from the same problem.

* There is a deficiency in the design of "lcg-info-dynamic-scheduler" 
  that can result in seemingly incorrect values being reported...

  In particular,  the script fails to take into account:

  * The maximum number of slots each queue is permitted to use
  * Which queues & VOs are allowed to use each slot

  Values are likely to end up most accurate when:

  * All queues (and VOs) have access to the same set of execution
    slots

  This problem is particularly apparent in the calculation of the
  per VO values for "GlueCEStateFreeJobSlots"

  In addition,  

  * the system may underestimate response times in situations where 
  there are free slots available in the cluster that are unavailable 
  for use by specific VOs/queues AND there are no queued jobs for 
  those VOs/queues   (therefore the system can't detect that the
  slots are ineligible to be used)

  and 

  * overestimate worst case response times when some slots
    are reserved for running certain categories of jobs

  In order to fix this problem,  the interfaces that 
  lcg-info-dynamic-scheduler uses to obtain information about the
  queuing system would need to be changed/enhanced.
  
  Enabling "vomaxjobs-sge" partially addresses the problem, but
  doesn't fix it.

* "lrmsinfo-sge" is currently unable to provide information about
  the time at which "running" jobs were queued due to the fact
  that qstat normally only reports the time at which jobs last
  changed state.

  Although the documentation for the "lrmsinfo" interface indicates
  that this information should be provided for all jobs,  an
  analysis of "lcg-info-dynamic-scheduler" seems to indicate that
  information is only currently referred to for jobs in "queued"
  state

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
* Each time the site BDII is updated,  the sge_helper script ends
  up running either two or three times (depending on whether
  "vo_max_jobs_cmd" is set) - performing almost identical queries 
  against the queuing system each time.

  It is intended that a future version of the script will cache
  results in a file so that the duplicated effort can be avoided

* Information about the state of the queues may be cached between
  runs so that the "queued" time for each job can be recorded
  for use by "lrmsinfo-sge".   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. FEEDBACK & PROBLEMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any problems/feedback relating to the information reporter should be
sent via email to the current maintainer as listed in the AUTHORS
file.

The "capture_file" facility supported by earlier versions of
lcg-info-dynamic-sge is unfortunately not currently available.

Instead,  if you wish to report a problem, please include the contents of
any configuration files along with the output of the command 
"qstat -xml -u * -f -r -F"
