# SGE JobManager queue mapping file
# =================================
#
# It is sometimes desirable to be able to override various RSL properties of
# jobs submitted to Globus based on the name of the queue that was requested.
#
# For example, LCG 2_6_0 resource brokers only allow an end user to specify
# a particular queue or set of queues for a job to be submitted to, but not
# to specify any other details about the job, such as how long it will take
# to execute.
#
# This file allows you to override the properties of a job based on the name
# of the logical queue that it was submitted to.

# Set of properties you can manipulate:
# ------------------------------------
# queue:                Set the target queue to submit to.
#                       NOTE: All property matches will match against the
#                             originally specified queue, not the new queue.
# max_cpu_time:         Hard CPU time limit, in minutes.
# max_wall_time:        Hard wallclock time limit, in minutes.
#
# (There is undocumented support for other fields.)
#
# Spaces are currently not permitted as any value.

# Starting from version 0.9 of the information provider,  the default
# queue mapping for any queues not listed in here is for the virtual
# queue to map directly onto a real queue of the same name...  which
# is equivalant to the entry:
#
#       <queuename>   queue   <queuename>

# Virtual
# Queue         Property                New Value
